# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Time Management – I now break tasks into smaller steps and set deadlines, which helps me stay on track and avoid last-minute stress.
Coding Approach – I focus on writing clearer, well-structured code by using meaningful variable names and avoiding magic numbers.
Debugging – Instead of guessing, I use systematic testing and debugging tools, which makes finding errors more efficient.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Approach – I need to plan more before coding to avoid unnecessary rewrites and ensure a clearer structure.
Time on Task – I sometimes underestimate how long tasks take, so I need to allocate extra buffer time.
Focus – I need to minimize distractions and stick to deep work sessions for better efficiency.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Structured Coding – Writing clear, well-organized code with meaningful names and avoiding magic numbers.
Debugging Methods – Using systematic debugging rather than trial-and-error, which makes troubleshooting more efficient.
Consistent Learning – Actively seeking feedback and improving based on past mistakes.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Reduce Last-Minute Work – Avoid procrastination by starting tasks earlier and sticking to my schedule.
Ask for Help Sooner – Seek clarification earlier instead of struggling too long with a problem.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Working on practical, hands-on projects that simulate real industry challenges would help reinforce concepts better than just theoretical exercises.
